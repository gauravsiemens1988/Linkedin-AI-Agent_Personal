🚀 The future of India’s energy landscape depends on our commitment to renewables! The recent article in Moneycontrol highlights a crucial call to action from the renewable energy sector, urging the government for support in manufacturing, energy storage, and green hydrogen initiatives in the upcoming Budget 2026.

This support is indispensable for advancing our energy transition goals and achieving sustainability targets. By focusing on these areas, India can harness local resources, foster innovation, and create jobs, all while reducing our carbon footprint.

Investing in green hydrogen and energy storage technologies not only enhances our energy security but also positions India as a leader in the global renewable economy.
